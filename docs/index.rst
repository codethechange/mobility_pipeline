Project Overview
----------------

mobility_pipeline uses the relative geographical positions of cell towers and
administrative regions (e.g. provinces) to transform mobility data describing
how people move between cell towers into data on how people move between
administrative regions. This lets us turn cell tower movement data that
telecommunications providers already have into data on migration patters between
political regions, which is what governments and NGOs need to plan disaster
relief efforts.
