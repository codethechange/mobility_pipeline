==========
Guidelines
==========

Any code contributions should follow the following guidelines.

----------
Code Style
----------

Python code should conform to the
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style guidelines.

Docstrings should conform to the
`Google Style <https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings>`_.
For example (copied from
`Google's Style Guide <https://github.com/google/styleguide>`_):

.. code-block:: python

    def fetch_bigtable_rows(big_table, keys, other_silly_variable=None):
        """Fetches rows from a Bigtable.

        Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
        represented by big_table.  Silly things may happen if
        other_silly_variable is not None.

        Args:
            big_table: An open Bigtable Table instance.
            keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row
                to fetch.
            other_silly_variable: Another optional variable, that has a much
                longer name than the other args, and which does nothing.

        Returns:
            A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
            fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
            example:

            {'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
             'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
             'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

            If a key from the keys argument is missing from the dictionary,
            then that row was not found in the table.

        Raises:
            IOError: An error occurred accessing the bigtable.Table object.
        """

-------
Testing
-------

To run all tests, execute ``test.sh``. All tests should pass on your submission.

Travis CI
*********
These tests are checked are run by
`Travis CI <https://travis-ci.com>`_ on all pull requests and the master branch.
Before each commit, run ``test.sh`` and ensure that all tests pass. All tests
should pass on each commit to make reverting easy.

Unit Testing
************

Unit testing is performed using `pytest <https://pytest.org/>`_. To run these
tests, execute ``python -m pytest`` from the repository root.

Code and Style Analysis
***********************

PEP8 are checked by ``pylint``.
``pylint`` also performs static code analysis to catch some programming errors.
This analysis is intended to be a fall-back defense, as unit testing should be
thorough.

Type Checking
*************

All code should use type hints wherever type cannot be inferred. At a minimum,
all function prototypes should have type hints for the return value and each
parameter. Type hinting is performed in the code itself, not in docstrings.
Static type analysis is performed by ``mypy``

Code Coverage
*************

When running the test suite using ``test.sh``, code coverage is computed by
`pytest-cov <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ when running
``pytest`` and output after test results. Use these results to ensure that all
tests are being covered. If the total coverage is not ``100%``, run
``coverage report -m`` to see which lines were not tested. Incomplete coverage
may be acceptable if the untested lines should not have been tested (e.g. code
stubs for un-implemented functions).

Coverage is tracked by `Codecov <https://codecov.io>`_.
